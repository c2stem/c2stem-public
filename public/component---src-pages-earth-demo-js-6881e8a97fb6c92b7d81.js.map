Runoff also affects the school itself, as the areas get very muddy and as a result recess can\n                get moved inside, or even canceled. To address these problems, the students will make design proposals\n                of the school's playground to: (1) Reduce water runoff during heavy rain; (2) Make outside areas\n                accessible to students in wheelchairs; (3) Stay within the budget; and (4) Contain evidence that\n                your designs will work for heavy rain.</p>\n              <p>Students can implement and test their playground design ideas in C2STEM. They can interact with a\n                  computational model by simulating rainfall and the resulting runoff under different conditions\n                  (different rainfall intensities and durations) and with different playground designs (selecting\n                  different surface materials for each grid in a 4x4 playground grid). By testing their engineering\n                  design proposal, students can also systematically explore a vast solution space.</p>\n              <iframe src=\"https://earth.c2stem.org/#present:Username=nzhang_es&ProjectName=SPICE-ES-BYPG-V5\" height=\"600\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n              <p></p>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Generic\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
